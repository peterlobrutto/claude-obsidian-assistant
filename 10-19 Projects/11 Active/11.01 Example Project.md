# Weather Dashboard

A real-time weather dashboard built with React and the OpenWeatherMap API. Currently in active development — core UI is complete, working on adding 7-day forecast charts and location search autocomplete.

**Location:** `~/projects/weather-dashboard`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/your-username/weather-dashboard
**Port:** localhost:5173

## Stack

| Layer | Tech | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Framework | Vite 6 | Build tool and dev server |
| UI | React 19, CSS Modules | Component-based interface |
| Language | TypeScript 5 | Type safety |
| Data | OpenWeatherMap API | Weather data provider |
| Charts | Recharts | Forecast visualizations |
| Persistence | localStorage | Saved locations |

Lightweight SPA with no backend — all API calls happen client-side with a proxy for the API key.

## Architecture

### Core Systems

`User Input` -> `Location Service` -> `Weather API` -> `Data Transform` -> `Dashboard UI`

### Data Flow
1. User enters location or uses geolocation
2. Geocoding API resolves to lat/lng
3. Weather API fetches current + forecast data
4. Transform layer normalizes units and extracts display values
5. React components render cards, charts, and alerts

|------|---------|
| `src/App.tsx` | Root component, layout, routing |
| `src/hooks/useWeather.ts` | Custom hook for API calls and caching |

| `src/components/ForecastChart.tsx` | 7-day forecast line chart |
| `src/services/weather-api.ts` | API client with rate limiting |
| `src/utils/transform.ts` | Unit conversion, data normalization |
| `vite.config.ts` | Dev server config, API proxy |
