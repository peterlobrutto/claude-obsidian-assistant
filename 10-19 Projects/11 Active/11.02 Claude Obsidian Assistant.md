# Claude Obsidian Assistant

A starter Obsidian vault pre-configured for Claude Code, providing a Johnny Decimal folder structure, a `/obsidian` sync skill, and five CSS themes out of the box. The project is at v1.0 with the core structure complete — it's a customizable template that lets Claude manage project notes, dev logs, and architecture diagrams directly from any codebase.

**Location:** `/Users/peterlobrutto/Downloads/Claude Code/claude-obsidian-assistant`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/peterlobrutto/claude-obsidian-assistant.git

## Stack

| Layer | Tech | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Vault | Obsidian | Markdown rendering, canvas diagrams, plugin ecosystem |
| Organization | Johnny Decimal | Numbered folder system for consistent file location |
| Skill | Claude Code `/obsidian` | 5-phase project-to-vault sync automation |
| Context | CLAUDE.md | Vault structure injected into Claude sessions |
| Styling | CSS Snippets (5 themes) | Sidebar colors, icons, and visual themes |
| Queries | Dataview (optional plugin) | Dynamic dashboard queries on the Home page |

No build system or runtime — the vault is pure markdown, JSON canvas files, and CSS.

## Architecture

### Core Systems

`Project Directory` -> `Claude Code /obsidian` -> `obsidian-sync.md Phases` -> `Vault Files`

`CLAUDE.md` -> `Claude Session Context` -> `Informed Edits`

### Sync Flow
1. User runs `/obsidian` from a project directory
2. Phase 1 scans `10-19 Projects/11 Active/` for a matching Location field
3. Phase 2 reads git log, package.json, and directory structure
4. Phase 3 presents an action menu (create, update, dev log, canvas, vault map)
5. Phase 4 writes markdown/JSON files to the vault
6. Phase 5 reports what changed

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Root context file — explains vault structure and rules to Claude |
| `claude-code/obsidian-sync.md` | The `/obsidian` skill definition — all 5 sync phases |
| `claude-code/SETUP.md` | Quick-start guide: copy skill, set VAULT_PATH, run /obsidian |
| `claude-code/canvas-reference.md` | Canvas JSON format reference for Claude canvas generation |
| `claude-code/CLAUDE.md` | Duplicate context file stored inside vault for portability |
| `00-09 System/00 Meta/00.01 Home.md` | Dataview dashboard: active projects, recent notes, tracking |
| `00-09 System/00 Meta/00.02 Vault Map.canvas` | Visual map of all JD areas and vault contents |
| `00-09 System/01 Templates/01.01 Project.md` | Standard project file template |
| `.obsidian/snippets/` | Five self-contained CSS themes (base, CRT, Y2K, RuneScape, coquette) |
